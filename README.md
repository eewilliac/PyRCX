# PyRCX
Experiment with Python and RCX
This is my quick and dirty experiment with Python and RCX.
This folder has all the requisite system files, in order for the RCX tower (connected to serial) to communicate
with the RCX brick.
In order to download firmware onto brick you must run the following command.
nqc -SCOM<1,2 or 3> -firmware firm0309.lgo eg: nqc -SCOM3 -firmware firm0309.lgo
